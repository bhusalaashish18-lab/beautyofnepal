    Nepal's tourism sector is facing mixed signals. While the country received over 500,000 foreign tourists in the
    first five months of 2025, it also spent more on citizens traveling abroad than it earned from foreign tourists
    during the same period. The country is also exploring ways to boost tourism, such as a new digital nomad visa
    policy.
